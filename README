reverse geo ip - finds ip address blocks connected with a specific zip code with the maxmind geoip database

uses the free geoip2 downloadable databases

zip code is highest free accuracy available - best combination of accuracy but not an overload of results

works with the compressed CSV files, compressed for github's sake

RUNNING LOCALLY WITH CSV: very slow, expect 5 minute search times

RUNNING LOCALLY WITH SQL: faster, <1 second, added .pl files to create SQLite files
