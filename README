reverse geo ip - finds ip address blocks connected with a specific zip code with the maxmind geoip database

reverseFromCSV.pl:

root$ reverseFromCSV.pl 59715 //if the CSV file is in the local directory (GeoLite2-City-Blocks-IPv4.csv)

	or, if the csv file isn't in the local directory

root$ reverseFromCSV.pl /path/to/other/csv/file 59715

uses the free geoip2 downloadable databases

zip code is highest free accuracy available - best combination of accuracy but not an overload of results

works with the attached compressed CSV files, compressed for github's sake

RUNNING LOCALLY WITH CSV: moderate time, <30 seconds to parsing 80mb sql file 

RUNNING LOCALLY WITH SQL: faster, <1 second, added .pl files to create SQLite files
